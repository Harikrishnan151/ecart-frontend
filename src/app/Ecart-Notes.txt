     ECART - FRONTEND


1.   Create a new folder ECART
2.   Inside in it create new angular project - ng new ecart-frontend 
3.   Install thirdparty libraries

      MDB bootstrap - npm i mdb-angular-ui-kit
      fontawsome - npm i @fortawesome/fontawesome-free
      googlefonts -@import paste into style.class

4.   lazy loadind
     Lazy loading is a technology of angular that allows you to load JavaScript components
     when a specific route is activated. It improves application load time speed by
     splitting the application into many bundles. When the user navigates by the app,
     bundles are loaded as needed.

     Lazy loading helps to keep the bundle size small, which helps reduce load times.
     We must use the class decorator to create an Angular module @NgModule, and the
     decorator uses a metadata object that defines the module.
     

5.   Create a new module in angular - here we create product module for implementing lazy loading
      
      -> ng g m products --route products --module app.module

6.   Create comonents in lazy-loadind module(product module)
      -> ng g c products/allProducts
      -> ng g c products/viewProducts
      -> ng g c products/wishList
      -> ng g c products/cart

7.  Components that not included in lazy loading
     -> ng g c header
     -> ng g c footer
     -> ng g c pageNotFound

8.  Setup path

    localhost 4200 - all products => localhost:4200/allProducts
